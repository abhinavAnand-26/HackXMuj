For our CRM, We define a Scooter struct to store information about each scooter, including its manufacturer, current location, and status while integrating an end-to-end CRM system that effectively handles customer interactions, sales, and support can be difficult, especially if the system needs to interact with various other software (e.g., supply chain management, AI recommendation engine). 

For our AI model, We have taken a general code structure and algorithm, it requires specialized knowledge, data, and computational resources. This response offers a foundational framework to get you started, but you might need to consult with data scientists or AI experts for a fully functional implementation.

1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
Gather data: Collect data on scooters , customer preferences, past purchase behavior and customer feedbacks.
Clean and preprocess: Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize data.

2. Feature Engineering:
Create relevant features: Extract meaningful features from the collected data (e.g., price range, battery capacity, acceleration).
Consider customer-specific features: Incorporate features based on customer preferences (e.g., distance traveled daily, riding style).

3. Model Selection and Training.

Along with a scooter tracking system embedded in the AI toolkit.
